cluster_shell_scripts_functions: This repository contains the shell cluster function scripts which have been configured for running on the high performance computing environment and they have many options to select, if you want to use them on the computing environment, then remove the "echo" command after the "then" command for the execution otherwise if you will leave the "echo" then it will simply print the instruction to the command shell. To make it configurable provide the input parameters and then provide the $threads as the SLURM_THREADS or the PBS_THREADS on the PBS. You can run this with in the module import also byt doing "module import {specific module}".
